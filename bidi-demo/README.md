## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **uv**: Python package manager (used for all dependency management in this project) - [Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) ([add packages](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/) with `uv add <package>`)
- **Google Cloud SDK**: For GCP services - [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- **Terraform**: For infrastructure deployment - [Install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- **make**: Build automation tool - [Install](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (pre-installed on most Unix-based systems)


## Quick Start

Install required packages and launch the local development environment:

```bash
make install && make playground
```
> **📊 Observability Note:** Agent telemetry (Cloud Trace) is always enabled. Prompt-response logging (GCS, BigQuery, Cloud Logging) is **disabled** locally, **enabled by default** in deployed environments (metadata only - no prompts/responses). See [Monitoring and Observability](#monitoring-and-observability) for details.

## Usage

This template follows a "bring your own agent" approach - you focus on your business logic in `app/agent.py`, and the template handles the surrounding components (UI, infrastructure, deployment, monitoring).

Here’s the recommended workflow for local development:

1.  **Install Dependencies (if needed):**
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

2.  **Start the Full Stack Server:**
    The FastAPI server now serves both the backend API and frontend interface:
    ```bash
    make local-backend
    ```
    The server is ready when you see `INFO:     Application startup complete.` The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

    <details>
    <summary><b>Optional: Use AI Studio / API Key instead of Vertex AI</b></summary>

    By default, the backend uses Vertex AI and Application Default Credentials. If you prefer to use Google AI Studio and an API key:

    ```bash
    export VERTEXAI=false
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key" # Replace with your actual key
    make local-backend
    ```
    Ensure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set correctly in your environment.
    </details>
    <br>

    <details>
    <summary><b>Alternative: Run Frontend Separately</b></summary>

    If you prefer to run the frontend separately (useful for frontend development), you can still use:
    ```bash
    make ui
    ```
    This launches the frontend application, which connects to the backend server at `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  **Interact and Iterate:**
    *   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the integrated frontend.
    *   Click the play button in the UI to connect to the backend.
    *   Interact with the agent! Try prompts like: *"Using the tool you have, define Governance in the context MLOPs"*
    *   Modify the agent logic in `app/agent.py`. The backend server (FastAPI with `uvicorn --reload`) should automatically restart when you save changes. Refresh the frontend if needed to see behavioral changes.

## Deployment

> **Note:** For a streamlined one-command deployment of the entire CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure using Terraform, you can use the [`agent-starter-pack setup-cicd` CLI command](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/cli/setup_cicd.html). Currently supports GitHub with both Google Cloud Build and GitHub Actions as CI/CD runners.

### Dev Environment

You can test deployment towards a Dev Environment using the following command:

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-dev-project-id>
make deploy
```

**Note:** For secure access to your deployed backend, consider using Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) by running `make deploy IAP=true`.

The repository includes a Terraform configuration for the setup of the Dev Google Cloud project.
See [deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md) for instructions.

### Production Deployment

The repository includes a Terraform configuration for the setup of a production Google Cloud project. Refer to [deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to deploy the infrastructure and application.

## Monitoring and Observability

The application provides two levels of observability:

**1. Agent Telemetry Events (Always Enabled)**
- OpenTelemetry traces and spans exported to **Cloud Trace**
- Tracks agent execution, latency, and system metrics

**2. Prompt-Response Logging (Configurable)**
- GenAI instrumentation captures LLM interactions (tokens, model, timing)
- Exported to **Google Cloud Storage** (JSONL), **BigQuery** (external tables), and **Cloud Logging** (dedicated bucket)

| Environment | Prompt-Response Logging |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Local Development** (`make playground`) | ❌ Disabled by default |
| **Deployed Environments** (via Terraform) | ✅ **Enabled by default** (privacy-preserving: metadata only, no prompts/responses) |

**To enable locally:** Set `LOGS_BUCKET_NAME` and `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=NO_CONTENT`.

**To disable in deployments:** Edit Terraform config to set `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=false`.

See the [observability guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/observability.html) for detailed instructions, example queries, and visualization options.
